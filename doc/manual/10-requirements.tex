\label{chap:reqs}

\begin{description}
\item[Diskspace:] 10\,GB\footnote{when using \texttt{rm\_work} class}
  or 25\,GB per typical project.
\item[Network access:] Sources will be downloaded from HTTP/FTP
  servers and from CVS, Subversion (SVN), Mercuri (HG) and GIT version
  control systems. Hence it must be possible to reach services in the
  internet which are listening on
  \begin{itemize}
  \item port 80/tcp + 443/tcp  (HTTP + HTTPS, HG, SVN)
  \item port 2401/tcp (CVS pserver)
  \item port 3690/tcp (SVN)
  \item port 9418/tcp (git)
  \item port 4815/tcp (ELiTo download server)
  \end{itemize}
  from the development machine.

  There are provided tools to tunnel these protocols through HTTP
  proxy servers which allow the \texttt{CONNECT} method to the ports
  above.

  There will be downloaded 1--2\,GB of sources while building a
  typical project.
\item[Operating system:] Although every recent GNU/Linux distribution
  should be supported, the toolchain has been tested only on
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Fedora 13
  \item \href{http://centos.org}{CentOS 5} + \href{https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL}{EPEL}
  \item Ubuntu 9.10
  \end{itemize}
\item[Software:] ELiTo is self containing and ships all programs which
  are not part of a recent GNU/Linux distribution.
